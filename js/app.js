// 1. VERBAL QUESTIONS:
/*
Parameters is what is declared after the function variable. 
Arguments are where you place the value 
in what's being called. Arguments, after being given,
will be placed in the  parameters.

Within in function, the return if just saying what
to do with the parameters. It doesn't ooutput anything. 
Console.log shows what is happening in the code. 

The implicationos of a 'return' returning a value 
is that in a function the 'return' returns the value 
of that function to be executed again. 
When we console.log the function, it will return
one of the return values.
